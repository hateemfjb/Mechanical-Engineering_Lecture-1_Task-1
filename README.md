### Task 1.1:
. *Cigarette ashtray:* is an essential piece of furniture, whether it is in a public place or in a private business setting. It offers a solution for smokers to throw away their cigarette butt, and is sometimes a better choice than a simple litter bin. Outdoor ashtrays are smaller than bins so easier to install anywhere.

## Getting Started


### Creating a Document

1.  *Name Your Document:*
   - Give your document a meaningful name to easily identify it later.

## Designing Your Model

### Step 1: Sketching

1. *Select a Plane:*
   - Choose one of the main planes (Front, Top, or Right) where you will start your sketch.

2. *Create a Sketch:*
   - Utilize various sketch tools to draw the basic 2D shape of your model.

3. *Apply Dimensions:*
   - Use the dimension tool to ensure accuracy by setting sizes and positions for your sketch elements.

### Step 2: Extrusion

1. *Extrude Your Sketch:*
   - Use the extrude tool to transform your 2D sketch into a 3D object.
   - Specify the extrusion depth and choose between solid or hollow features.

### Step 3: Adding Features

1. *Enhance Your Model:*
   - Use tools like fillets, chamfers, holes, or patterns to add detail and functionality.

### Step 4: Assembly (if applicable)

1. *Create an Assembly:*
   - For projects with multiple parts, move to the assembly workspace.
   - Use mates to define relationships and connect parts precisely.

### Step 5: Inspection and Refinement

1. *Inspect Your Model:*
   - Use section views and other tools to examine internal structures or details.
   - Make refinements as necessary to ensure the model meets all design specifications.

## Finalizing Your Design

### Export or Share

1. *Export Your Model:*
   - Once complete, export the model in the desired format for manufacturing or 3D printing.

2. *Share Your Design:*
   - Collaborate with others by sharing the document within Onshape.


### Task 1.2:
. *Water glass:* is sold as solid lumps or powders or as a clear, syrupy liquid. It is used as a convenient source of sodium for many industrial products, as a builder in laundry detergents, as a binder and adhesive, as a flocculant in water-treatment plants, and in many other applications.

## Getting Started

## Design Steps

### Create a New Document

1. *Open Onshape:*
   - Log into your Onshape account and click the “Create” button to start a new document for your water glass model.

### Sketch the Glass Profile

1. *Select a Plane:*
   - Choose the Top or Right Plane to begin a sketch.

2. *Draw Profile:*
   - Use line and arc tools to draw half of a cross-sectional view of your glass.
   - Start with a vertical line for the glass height, and add an arc for the rounded base.
   - Extend the profile upwards, curving slightly outward for a tapered shape if desired.

### Define Dimensions

1. *Dimension the Sketch:*
   - Use the dimension tool to set specific values for the height, top diameter, and base curve radius appropriate for your design.

### Revolve the Profile

1. *Revolve Feature:*
   - Select the revolve tool to rotate your sketch around the vertical line (axis) to form the full cylindrical body of the glass.
   - Ensure you create a solid body through the revolve operation.

### Hollow Out the Glass

1. *Internal Profile Sketch:*
   - On the same plane, sketch an inner profile, scaled down and offset from the outer profile to define the wall thickness.
2. *Revolve Cut:*
   - Use the revolve cut feature with the new profile to hollow out the inside of your glass.

### Add Details

1. *Optional Enhancements:*
   - Apply fillets to smooth sharp edges on the rim or base for a finished look.

### Inspect and Finalize

1. *Model Check:*
   - Review the 3D view of your model, ensuring all design criteria are met and make final adjustments as needed.

## Finalization

1. *Save Your Document:*
   - Confirm that your design is complete and save the work in Onshape.
